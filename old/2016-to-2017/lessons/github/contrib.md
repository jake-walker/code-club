# Your first contribution on GitHub

Firstly go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and make a new account (or sign in if you already have one).

Then go to [the Code Club Site repository](https://github.com/jake-walker/code-club) and click the fork button.

Now in the title section you will see a fork symbol, your username and `code-club`:

Now we are going to edit the home page and submit it to the main repository. If it's a good enough change I will accept it. Open the `index.html` file by clicking on it:

then clicking the pencil icon.

Change something like the footer still says 2016, if someone hasn't already change it to 2017. Change the font, whatever you like.

Scroll to the bottom of the page where you will get a box saying `Commit changes`. Here you will want to put a useful message on what you've changed. It doesn't have to be super informative because someone can see what you've changed easily. Then click `Commit changes`.

It will go back to the file so go back to the main page of your repository. It will tell you that your branch is 1 commit ahead:

There is a button at the end that says `Pull Request`. Click it and it will come up with a page asking to Compare Changes.

1. You shouldn't need to change this but you can select which branch to merge to.
1. Shows you information about your fork.
1. Shows the lines you edited. Lines that are red is the ones you have removed. Green lines are ones you've added.
1. Click this button to request to merge it then add a message saying what you've changed click `OK`.

Now it will show you a page about your Pull Request and will notify the owner.

Because I own the repository I can choose to merge the pull request which means I accept the changes and it will change the code in the main repository.

Now if I go to the main repository you can see that my change is there:

We are going to use GitHub to manage the code for our communal project.
