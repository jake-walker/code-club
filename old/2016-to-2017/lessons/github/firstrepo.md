# Making your own Repository

Go to the GitHub homepage and click `New Repository` on the sidebar:

Now you will have a screen like this:

1. **Repo Name**. *self-explanitory*
1. **Description**. *self-explanitory*
1. **Visibility**. Public means anyone can see it and copy (fork) it.
1. **Visibility**. Private means nobody can see it without your permission. You have to pay $5/month for this feature.
1. **`.gitignore`**. Files that GitHub should ignore. This is very useful when you have the repository on your computer because you can exclude a file that is automatically generated by Windows or a plugins folder.
1. **Licence**. Licences show people what they can and can't do with your code. Some licences allow people to edit and update your code but they must provide credit.

Make your repository public and select `Initialize this repository with a README` then click `Create repository`.

Now you will have a blank repository:

First lets edit the README file.

The README file is written in Markdown (so is this page). [Here are the basics](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). You can also use HTML but once you get to know Markdown it's a lot easier than HTML.

Add something to the file and then commit the changes like in the last page.

*You don't have to write a title for the commit and it will automatically generate you one. It's always better to add one though.*
